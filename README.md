Searching for Courier by Postal Code

This web application allows you to search for a courier route by postal code. After entering a postal code and clicking the "Sprawd≈∫" button, the application displays towns and the name of the courier that delivers packages to that postal code.

How does the application work?

The application uses a database that contains information about postal codes and the couriers assigned to them. After the user enters a postal code, the application searches for the corresponding record in the database and returns the name of the courier.


Technologies

The application was written in JavaScript(json database).
